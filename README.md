## Getting Started

Small game inspired from Russpack. Maybe it is the same, I don't remember the game correctly.

## Stack

This is project uses : 
 - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
 - [Xstate](https://stately.ai/docs)to manage the state machine.
 - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
 - [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) For the UI components.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The machine logic is in `app/swapMachine.ts`, you can preview it with the [xstate vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statelyai.stately-vscode).
